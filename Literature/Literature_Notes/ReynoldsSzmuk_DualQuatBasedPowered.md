# DualQuaternionBasedPoweredDescentGuidance withState-TriggeredConstraints
Authors: Reynolds and Szmuk

Abstract
- Presentation of numerical 6 dof free-final time powered descent guidance trajectories
- Trajectory created with unit dual quat of dynamics and path constraints.
- Newly introduced state-triggered constraints that are good for real time operation
- Two studies:
  - Effect of slant-range-triggered line of sight constraint on trajectories
  - Monte Carlo analysis to assess the algorithm's robustness to initial conditions and real-time performance

Introduction 
- Paper presents algorithm that is designed to compute fuel-optimal trajectories in real time that explicitly account for constraints.
- Constraint satisfaction in this paper allows for less accessible landing areas (more interesting)
- First work to present unit dual quaternion approach to feedforward trajectory generation

Conclusion
- Two numerical cases studied lunar descent scenario where it was shown that state triggered constraints are effective
