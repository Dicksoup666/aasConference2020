# Spatial Rigid Body Dynamics using Dual Quaternion Components

Abstract
- Dual quaternions require two extra constraint equations
- Double pendulum example using dual quaternions

Introduction 
- Before this paper, no work was done to solve dynamics equations with dual quats
- Gives formulation of general dynamics problem using dual quaternion components

Conclusion
- Technique has both disadvantages and advantages
  - Cons
    - Equations can be complicated
    - Physical significance of variables are not intuitively apparent
  - Pros
    - Kinematics can be obtained easily because of multiplicative properties
    - Constraint equations come in a simple form
    - Can solve more complicated problems involving chains
