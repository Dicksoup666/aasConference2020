# Model Predictive Control for Spacecraft Rendezvous

Abstract
- Trajectory control using MPC
- Two scenarios:
  - Position control with fuel constraint
  - Position control with obstacles

Introduction
- They mention hard and soft constraint methods
- They use soft constraints
  - Collision avoidance constraints are expressed implicitly in control performance cost function
- Analysis done:
  - Fuel efficiency
  - Collision avoidance



Conclusion
- Succesful analysis
- Used CWH equations for relative motion
	
## Conclusion 
"The problem of spacecraft rendezvous was discussed using simulation studies on the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations. The Model Predictive Control technique was used to perform trajectory control with collision avoidance using soft constraint method. The simulation studies successfully validated the proposed control methodology."
