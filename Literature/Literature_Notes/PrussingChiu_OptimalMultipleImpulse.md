# Optimal Multiple-Impulse Time-Fixed Rendezvous Between Circular Orbits
Authors: Prussing and Chiu

Abstract
- Minimum fuel, multiple impulse, time fixed solutions are obtained for circle to circle rendezvous
- Coplanar and a subset of noncoplanar cases are analyzed 
- Results can be used to perform time vs fuel trade off

Introduction 
- Rendezvous from chaser orbit to target orbit can be done in two impulses
  - First impulse places vehicle on trajectory to intercept at a certain time
  - Second impulse matches vehicle velocity of chaser to target
- Minimum fuel solution for simple planar circle-to-circle rendezvous is called Hohmann transfer
- Phasing must be considered to get optimal rendezvous
- This study determines optimal, multiple-impulse, time-fixed solutions for coplanar circle-to-circle rendezvous and for a restricted class of non-coplanar rendezvous

Conclusion
- Solutions arrived at with primer vector theory (?)
- More than two impulses can sometimes save more fuel than two impulse solutions
## Conclusion
"For both coplanar and a restricted class of noncoplanar circle-to-circle rendezvous, optimal, time-fixed, multiple- impulse solutions have been obtained using primer vector theory. The results are useful for a time vs fuel trade-off for missions which have operational time constraints, such as space rescue missions or avoidance maneuvers. For sufficiently large transfer times, the solutions become the well-known time-open solutions, such as the Hohmann transfer for the coplanar case. For specified transfer times which are less than the time-open values, optimal time-fixed solutions are obtained, including the optimal number of im- pulses, their times and locations, and the existence and dura- tion of initial or final coasting arcs. Optimal time-fixed solu- tions often use additional impulses to minimize fuel, and can provide a significant fuel savings over two-impulse solutions. Another interesting aspect of the results is that even in cases where the specified transfer time is relatively small, the op- timal solution may employ initial or final coasting arcs in order to take advantage of more favorable geometry. The question of global optimality of the minimizing solu- tions is an important consideration. If the optimal time-fixed solutions approach the known time-open global optimal solu- tions as the transfer time is increased, one can be fairly confi- dent that the solutions are globally optimal. However, the iteration algorithm can and sometimes does converge to only a local minimum, which does not tend toward the known time- open optimal solution. In this case, one must introduce an ad- ditional impulse or a coast period to cause the algorithm to ex- plore other possibilities in its convergence to an optimal solution. "
