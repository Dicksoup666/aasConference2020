# Meeting Notes

Meeting Notes will be organized from most recent date to earliest date. 

## 1/24/2020 

Simulation 
- Nonlinear equations --> Simulink 
- Build dynamic model, add noise 
- Generate x, y, z data 
- Use SINDy for state identification 
	- Get differential equations 
	
Controller 
- MPC (model-predictive control) or reinforcement learning 
- Add disturbances, check controller performance 
- Compare design
	- which system is more intuitive, easy to use? 
	
Dual quaternions 
- Need to use kinematics + dual quaternion equations 
	
Tasks
- Review literature 
- Write introduction 
- Come up with paper title 
- Use Mendeley with LaTeX? 

NASA Fellowship 
- Possible: swarm project at Ames 
- Phase 1 proposal due: Feb 21, 2020
