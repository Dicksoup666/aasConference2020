# aasConference2020

This is the repo for managing papers and code for the AAS/AIAA Conference 2020. 

The conference will be held August 9 - 13, 2020 at the Lake Tahoe Resort Hotel in South Lake Tahoe, CA. 

The abstract deadline is April 10, 2020. Notification of acceptance will be sent via email by May 9, 2020. More details can be found on the conference website https://www.space-flight.org/docs/2020_summer/2020_summer.html.  

# Meeting Notes

Meeting Notes will be organized from most recent date to earliest date. 

## 1/24/2020 

Simulation 
- Nonlinear equations --> Simulink 
- Build dynamic model, add noise 
- Generate x, y, z data 
- Use SINDy for state identification 
	- Get differential equations 
	
Controller 
- MPC (model-predictive control) or reinforcement learning 
- Add disturbances, check controller performance 
- Compare design
	- which system is more intuitive, easy to use? 
	
Dual quaternions 
- Need to use kinematics + dual quaternion equations 

NASA Fellowship 
- Possible: swarm project at Ames 
- Phase 1 proposal due: Feb 21, 2020
	
### Tasks
- Review literature 
- Write introduction 
- Come up with paper title 
- Use Mendeley with LaTeX? 

## 1/17/2020 

Focus on 3 topics: 

1. MPC (model-predictive control) 
2. SINDy
